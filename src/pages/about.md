## Little things about myself!

I'm 17 years old studying at [Dusit Commercial Nonthaburi Vocational College](https://dusitnon.ac.th) for Vocational Certificate in Computer Business. And interest in coding and tech all around.

This blog site is mostly all about me, sometime if I have an event, Maybe I will post here (at some point.) and also, this blog site based on Astro baaed on AstroPaper that I mostly modified for my needs.

## For who that don't know about AstroPaper,

AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. I designed and crafted this based on [Sat Naing's Blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog) aimed to be accessible out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by default and additional color schemes can also be configured.

## Features

Here are certain features of this site.

- fully responsive and accessible
- SEO-friendly
- light & dark mode
- fuzzy search
- super fast performance
- draft posts
- pagination
- sitemap & rss feed
- highly customizable
